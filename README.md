ToDoList
========

A simple To Do List or Task Management app

This To Do List was a homework project while at The Iron Yard Academy.  

This was my first experience with the Parse Database for a back end to my applications.  Parse was used to persist data in this application and would be used in other projects from hear on out based on what was learned in this application.
